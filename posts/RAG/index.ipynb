        "\n",
        "In real organizations, the most valuable knowledge lives in internal documents, databases, and systems that change over time. Because this information isn’t part of an LLM’s training data, standalone models quickly fall short. They may sound confident, but their answers are often incomplete, outdated, or simply wrong.\n",

        "* They can’t reliably answer questions over **internal documents**\n",
        "* They struggle to query **enterprise databases**\n",
        "* They tend to **hallucinate** when context is missing\n",
        "* They don’t naturally respect **security and access boundaries**\n",
        "\n",
        "Modern AI systems solve this not by training bigger models, but by **connecting models to data** carefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project implements a **hybrid knowledge access system** that combines two proven patterns:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for unstructured data like PDFs, reports, and internal documentation\n",
        "* **A tool-driven SQL agent** for structured data stored in PostgreSQL databases\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of treating the LLM as a source of truth, the system uses it as a **reasoning layer**. The model retrieves evidence from private sources, reasons over it, and produces answers that are grounded in real data.\n",
        "\n",
        "At a high level:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. A user asks a natural-language question\n",
        "2. The system determines whether the answer requires documents, databases, or both\n",
        "3. Relevant information is retrieved from internal sources\n",
        "4. The LLM generates a response **based only on that retrieved context**\n",
