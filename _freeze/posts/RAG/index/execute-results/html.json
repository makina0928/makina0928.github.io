This gives them strong general language skills.<br>\n\nIn real organizations, the most valuable knowledge lives in internal documents, databases, and systems that change over time. Because this information isn’t part of an LLM’s training data, standalone models quickly fall short. They may sound confident, but their answers are often incomplete, outdated, or simply wrong.\n\nThis shows up in practical ways:\n\n* They can’t reliably answer questions over **internal documents**\n* They struggle to query **enterprise databases**\n* They tend to **hallucinate** when context is missing\n* They don’t naturally respect **security and access boundaries**\n\nModern AI systems solve this not by training bigger models, but by **connecting models to data** carefully.\n\nThis project implements a **hybrid knowledge access system** that combines two proven patterns:\n\n* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for unstructured data like PDFs, reports, and internal documentation\n* **A tool-driven SQL agent** for structured data stored in PostgreSQL databases\n\nInstead of treating the LLM as a source of truth, the system uses it as a **reasoning layer**. The model retrieves evidence from private sources, reasons over it, and produces answers that are grounded in real data.\n\nAt a high level:\n\n1. A user asks a natural-language question\n2. The system determines whether the answer requires documents, databases, or both\n3. Relevant information is retrieved from internal sources\n4. The LLM generates a response **based only on that retrieved context**\n\nThe goal of this project is not just to build a working RAG pipeline, but to engineer a **reliable, modular, and production-ready hybrid architecture** that makes LLMs useful inside real systems.\n\n---\n\n# Problem Definition\n\nOrganizations don’t store knowledge in one place. It’s spread across:\n\n* Unstructured documents such as PDFs, manuals, and internal policies\n* Structured databases containing operational and analytical data\n\nLLMs provide a powerful natural-language interface, but on their own they **cannot safely operate over private or evolving data**. Without external grounding, models hallucinate, return stale information, and offer answers that can’t be verified.\n\nThe real challenge is not generation, but **controlled access to knowledge**.\n\nA practical system must:\n\n* Ground every answer in **retrieved evidence**\n* Work across **both documents and databases**\n* Enforce **read-only access and security constraints**\n* Scale to large data volumes\n* Keep latency and cost predictable\n* Support debugging and evaluation\n\nThis project addresses those requirements by combining:\n\n* A **RAG pipeline** for document retrieval and context construction\n* A **tool-mediated SQL agent** that safely translates questions into validated, read-only queries\n\nThe result is a **hybrid architecture with RAG and SQL Agent** where the LLM reasons, tools retrieve, and data remains protected, producing answers that are explainable, auditable, and grounded.\n\n---\n\n# RAG Stream: From Raw Documents to Grounded Answers\n\nThis section walks through the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** stream of the project, explaining how raw documents are transformed into reliable, context-aware answers.\n\nThe goal of this stream is to **allow an LLM to answer questions using private documents without hallucinating or guessing.**\n\n---\n\n![](rag.png)\n\n\n## Document Ingestion & Parsing\n\nThe pipeline begins with raw documents such as PDFs, DOCX files, spreadsheets, or HTML pages. These documents must first be converted into clean, structured text before any downstream processing is possible. This project uses *Docling* to convert a wide range of document formats into **structured markdown**, preserving headings and layout information better than simple text extractors.\n \n### Why this choice\n\n* Handles **complex PDFs** more reliably\n* Produces **clean, readable markdown**\n* Works well with scanned documents via OCR\n* Easier to enrich with metadata (headings, sections)\n\n---\n\n## Chunking the Document\n\nLarge documents are split into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks. This is essential because:\n\n* Embedding models have input limits\n* Smaller chunks improve retrieval accuracy\n\nThis project uses **Chonkie’s RecursiveChunker**, which is character-based, LLM-agnostic and production-safe. Chunks are created with:\n\n* A fixed size (2048 characters)\n* Minimum length enforcement\n* Stable character offsets for traceability\n\n### Why this choice\n\n* Deterministic and predictable\n* No dependency on tokenizers or LLMs\n* Easy to debug and evaluate\n\n---\n\n## Embedding Generation\n\nEach chunk is converted into a numerical vector (embedding) using **Sentence Transformers (local)** to capture each chunk's semantic meaning. The same process is later applied to user queries. 768-dimensional embeddings are generated locally and cached to avoid recomputation.\n\n### Why this choice\n\n* No external API dependency\n* Predictable cost (zero per-request fees)\n* Easy to swap models\n* Suitable for private environments\n\n---\n\n## Vector Storage & Retrieval\n\nAll chunk embeddings are stored in a vector database. At query time, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks using similarity search (Top-K document chunks are ranked by semantic similarity). This project uses **Qdrant** as the vector store, with the following key features:\n\n* Cosine similarity\n* Metadata filtering (namespace, filename)\n* Payload indexing\n* Async client for scalability\n\n### Why this choice\n\n* Open-source and production-ready\n* Strong filtering and indexing support\n* Clean Python API\n* Easy to self-host or run in the cloud\n\n---\n\n## Context Construction\n\nRetrieved chunks are formatted into a single context block, preserving:\n\n* Source filename\n* Relevance score\n* Optional heading hierarchy\n\nThis context becomes the **grounding evidence** for the LLM and is used to generate the final answer.\n\n### Why this matters\n\n* Improves answer quality\n* Enables traceability\n* Reduces hallucination risk\n\n---\n\n## Augmented Prompt Generation\n\nThe user’s question and the retrieved context are combined into a single prompt. The prompt explicitly instructs the LLM to use only the provided context and admit when information is missing. A grounded, constrained prompt is then sent to the LLM.\n\n---\n\n## Answer Generation\n\nThe LLM generates the final answer using the augmented prompt. This implementation uses **Groq LLM APIs** for fast inference, but the architecture is model-agnostic. A clear, grounded answer with optional source citations is returned to the user.\n\n---\n\n## Artifact & Cache Storage (Optional)\n\nTo improve performance and reproducibility, intermediate artifacts are stored in **Cloudflare R2** which is a low-cost object storage service and is S3-compatible. The following artifacts are stored:\n\n* Original documents\n* Chunks\n* Embeddings\n* Metadata\n\n### Why this matters\n\n* Faster reloads\n* Stateless services\n* Easy reindexing\n* Lower compute cost\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThis RAG stream turns raw, private documents into **grounded, auditable answers** by combining:\n\n* Robust document parsing\n* Deterministic chunking\n* Local embedding generation\n* Vector-based retrieval\n* Context-aware LLM prompting\n\nMost importantly, the LLM is **never treated as a source of truth**. It is a reasoning layer operating strictly on retrieved evidence.\n\n---\n\n# SQL Agent Stream: Safe Natural Language Access to Databases\n\nWhile the RAG stream handles unstructured knowledge like documents and manuals, many real-world questions require **direct access to structured data** stored in relational databases. This stream focuses on enabling **safe, reliable, and auditable database querying using natural language**, without giving the LLM unrestricted access to the database.\n\n---\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n\n    %% ======================\n    %% USER\n    %% ======================\n    A[User Question]\n\n    %% ======================\n    %% LLM\n    %% ======================\n    subgraph LLMBOX[\"<B>LLM (Reasoning Engine)</B>\"]\n        L1[Understand Question]\n        L2[Request Tools]\n        L3[Interpret Query Results]\n    end\n\n    %% ======================\n    %% SQL AGENT\n    %% ======================\n    subgraph AGENT[\"<B>SQL Agent Control</B>\"]\n        P[Agent Control Loop]\n        G[Guardrails & Constraints]\n    end\n\n    %% ======================\n    %% TOOLS\n    %% ======================\n    subgraph TOOLS[\"<B>Database Tools</B>\"]\n        T1[List Tables]\n        T2[Describe Tables]\n        T3[Sample Data]\n        T4[Execute Read-Only SQL]\n    end\n\n    %% ======================\n    %% DATABASE\n    %% ======================\n    subgraph DBLAYER[\" <B>Protected Database</B>\"]\n        D[(PostgreSQL Database)]\n    end\n\n    %% ======================\n    %% RESPONSE\n    %% ======================\n    R[<B>Final Answer to User</B>]\n\n    %% ======================\n    %% FLOW\n    %% ======================\n    A --> L1\n    L1 --> L2\n    L2 --> P\n\n    %% Guarded execution\n    P --> G\n    G --> TOOLS\n\n    TOOLS --> D\n    D --> P\n\n    %% Output control\n    P --> L3\n    L3 --> R\n\n    %% ======================\n    %% STYLES (LIGHT GRAY)\n    %% ======================\n    style LLMBOX fill:#f5f5f5,stroke:#d1d5db,stroke-width:2px\n    style AGENT fill:#f5f5f5,stroke:#d1d5db,stroke-width:2px\n    style TOOLS fill:#f5f5f5,stroke:#d1d5db,stroke-width:2px\n    style DBLAYER fill:#f9fafb,stroke:#d1d5db,stroke-width:2px\n    style A fill:#f9fafb,stroke:#d1d5db,stroke-width:2px\n    style R fill:#f9fafb,stroke:#d1d5db,stroke-width:2px\n\n```\n\n\n\n---\n\n## User Question\n\nA user submits a natural language question that requires database access. At this point, the system does **not** assume the question is valid or executable.\n\n---\n\n## LLM as a Reasoning Engine\n\nThe LLM receives the user question along with a **strict system prompt** that defines its role. In this project, the LLM is **not a data source** and **not allowed to answer directly**.\n\nIts responsibilities are limited to:\n\n* Understanding the user’s intent\n* Planning how to explore the database\n* Deciding *which tools to call and in what order*\n* Explaining its reasoning for every tool call\n\nThis separation ensures that:\n\n* The LLM **cannot hallucinate results**\n* All answers must be grounded in actual database queries\n* Every step is explainable and auditable\n\n---\n\n## Agent Control Loop\n\nThe SQL Agent runs inside a **controlled reasoning loop**, where each iteration performs the following steps:\n\n1. The LLM proposes tool calls\n2. Tools are executed by the system (not the LLM)\n3. Tool outputs are fed back to the LLM\n4. The loop continues until a final answer is produced\n\nThis loop is bounded by a maximum number of iterations and hard failure conditions. This design prevents:\n\n* Infinite reasoning loops\n* Unbounded database exploration\n* Uncontrolled compute costs\n\n---\n\n## Guardrails & Constraints\n\nBefore any SQL is executed, the system enforces **hard safety rules** that the LLM cannot override.\n\nThese include:\n\n* **Read-only enforcement**\n\n  * No INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP, ALTER, or CREATE\n* **Mandatory LIMIT clause**\n\n  * Prevents large result sets\n* **Schema validation**\n\n  * Only known tables and columns are allowed\n* **Tool usage enforcement**\n\n  * The LLM must call at least one database tool\n* **Temporal query guards**\n\n  * Prevents ambiguous “current” or “latest” queries without validation\n\nIf any rule is violated, execution stops immediately.\n\n---\n\n## Database Tools\n\nThe LLM can request a limited set of **explicit tools**, each designed for a specific purpose:\n\n* **List Tables**\n\n  * Discover available tables\n* **Describe Tables**\n\n  * Inspect schema and columns\n* **Sample Data**\n\n  * Preview small subsets of rows\n* **Execute Read-Only SQL**\n\n  * Run validated, constrained queries\n\nEach tool:\n\n* Requires a **reasoning parameter**\n* Runs inside controlled Python code\n* Uses a secure PostgreSQL connection\n\n### Why this matters\n\n* Tools act as the **only gateway** to the database.\n\n* The LLM never touches SQL execution directly.\n\n---\n\n## Protected Database Access\n\nAll database operations go through a protected PostgreSQL connection with:\n\n* Read-only enforcement\n* Cursor-level control\n* Automatic rollback on failure\n* Limited result sizes\n\nThe database is treated as a **protected system**, not an LLM playground.\n\n---\n\n## Interpreting Query Results\n\nTool results are returned to the LLM as structured messages then the LLM:\n\n* Interpret the data\n* Summarize insights\n* Translate technical results into business-friendly language\n\nCrucially, the LLM **does not fabricate numbers** and if no relevant data is found, it must say so explicitly.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer to the User\n\nOnce the LLM has:\n\n* Used at least one database tool\n* Passed all guardrails\n* Interpreted real query results\n\nIt produces a final answer that:\n\n* Is grounded in actual data\n* Is formatted in clear Markdown\n* Avoids exposing raw SQL unless requested\n* Is understandable to non-technical users\n\n---\n\nThis SQL Agent stream complements the RAG stream by enabling **safe, explainable access to structured data**, while preserving all the reliability guarantees required for real-world systems. Together, the **RAG stream** and **SQL Agent stream** form a unified knowledge access layer where:\n\n* Documents are retrieved, not guessed\n* Databases are queried, not hallucinated\n* LLMs reason, but never act unchecked\n\n---\n\n\n# Unified Hybrid Flow: RAG + SQL Agent\n\nModern organizations store knowledge in multiple forms. Some of it lives in **documents** like reports, manuals, and policies. Some of it lives in **databases** like transaction tables, analytics schemas, and operational systems. Treating these two worlds separately limits what users can ask.\n\nThis project implements a **unified hybrid flow** that allows a single natural-language question to be answered using:\n\n* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for unstructured documents\n* **A tool-driven SQL Agent** for structured relational data\n* Or **both together**, when the question requires combined reasoning\n\nThe system is designed so the LLM acts as a **reasoning layer**, while all data access is explicit, controlled, and auditable.\n\n---\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n\n    %% ======================\n    %% USER\n    %% ======================\n    subgraph USER[\"<B>User</B>\"]\n        A[User Asks a Question]\n    end\n\n    %% ======================\n    %% API GATEWAY\n    %% ======================\n    subgraph API[\"<B>API Gateway</B>\"]\n        B[API Receives the Question]\n    end\n\n    %% ======================\n    %% ROUTING SERVICE\n    %% ======================\n    subgraph ROUTING[\"<B>Routing Service</B>\"]\n        C[Decides the Best Path]\n    end\n\n    %% ======================\n    %% EXECUTION PATHS\n    %% ======================\n    subgraph EXEC[\"<B>Execution Paths</B>\"]\n        D[Query Business Database]\n        E[Search Knowledge Base]\n        F[Combine Sources if Needed]\n    end\n\n    %% ======================\n    %% DATA & KNOWLEDGE\n    %% ======================\n    subgraph DATA[\"<B>Data & Knowledge</B>\"]\n        G[(Business Database)]\n        H[(Knowledge Base)]\n        K[(Knowledge + Database)]\n    end\n\n    %% ======================\n    %% RESPONSE\n    %% ======================\n    subgraph RESPONSE[\"Response\"]\n        I[Generate Clear Answer]\n        J[Return Answer to User]\n    end\n\n    %% ======================\n    %% FLOW\n    %% ======================\n    A --> B\n    B --> C\n\n    C -->|Data Question| D\n    C -->|Knowledge Question| E\n    C -->|Mixed Question| F\n\n    D --> G\n    E --> H\n    F --> K\n\n    G --> I\n    H --> I\n    K --> I\n\n    I --> J\n\n    %% ======================\n    %% STYLES (LIGHT GRAY)\n    %% ======================\n    style USER fill:#f9fafb,stroke:#d1d5db,stroke-width:2px\n    style API fill:#f9fafb,stroke:#d1d5db,stroke-width:2px\n    style ROUTING fill:#f5f5f5,stroke:#d1d5db,stroke-width:2px\n    style EXEC fill:#f5f5f5,stroke:#d1d5db,stroke-width:2px\n    style DATA fill:#f9fafb,stroke:#d1d5db,stroke-width:2px\n    style RESPONSE fill:#f9fafb,stroke:#d1d5db,stroke-width:2px\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n## User Asks a Question\n\nThe flow begins when a user submits a natural-language question. At this point, the system does not assume *where* the answer should come from.\n\n---\n\n## API Gateway Receives the Request\n\nThe API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all queries. Its responsibilities include:\n\n* Accept the user question\n* Attach session and request metadata\n* Forward the question to the routing service\n\nNo reasoning or data access happens here.\n\n---\n\n## Routing Service Decides the Best Path\n\nThe Routing Service analyzes the question and determines **which execution path is required**:\n\n* **Data Question**\n  → Requires structured database access\n  → Route to the SQL Agent\n\n* **Knowledge Question**\n  → Requires document understanding\n  → Route to the RAG pipeline\n\n* **Mixed Question**\n  → Requires both documents *and* database facts\n  → Route to the hybrid execution path\n\n\n---\n\n## Execution Paths\n\n### SQL Agent Path (Structured Data)\n\nFor data-driven questions:\n\n* The SQL Agent uses the LLM as a **reasoning engine**\n* The LLM plans database exploration steps\n* Database tools are executed under strict guardrails:\n\n  * Read-only queries\n  * Schema validation\n  * Automatic limits\n  * Mandatory tool usage\n* The database remains fully protected\n\nThe LLM never executes SQL directly, it only reasons about *which tool should run next*.\n\n---\n\n### RAG Path (Unstructured Knowledge)\n\nFor document-driven questions:\n\n* Relevant documents are parsed and chunked\n* Embeddings are generated using a local embedding model\n* Similar chunks are retrieved from the vector database\n* Retrieved context is combined with the user question\n* The LLM generates an answer grounded strictly in retrieved content\n\nThis ensures answers are evidence-based, not hallucinated.\n\n---\n\n### Hybrid Path (Knowledge + Database)\n\nFor mixed questions:\n\n* The system retrieves relevant document context **and**\n* Executes validated SQL queries via the SQL Agent\n* Both sources are combined into a single augmented context\n* The LLM generates a unified answer that:\n\n  * Explains *what the documents say*\n  * References *what the data shows*\n\nThis allows true cross-source reasoning without compromising safety.\n\n---\n\n## Data & Knowledge Layer\n\nAll execution paths ultimately draw from the same **Data & Knowledge layer**, which includes:\n\n* **Business Database** (PostgreSQL)\n* **Knowledge Base** (vector store)\n* **Combined Knowledge + Database context** (for hybrid queries)\n\nThis layer is treated as the **source of truth**, never the LLM.\n\n---\n\n## Generate a Clear Answer\n\nOnce relevant data is retrieved:\n\n* The LLM interprets results\n* Converts technical outputs into human-readable explanations\n* Avoids fabricating missing information\n* Explicitly states when data is insufficient\n\nThe answer is formatted for clarity and trust, not verbosity.\n\n---\n\n## Return Answer to User\n\nThe final response is returned to the user with:\n\n* Clear reasoning\n* Grounded evidence\n* No hidden assumptions\n* No hallucinated facts\n\nFrom the user’s perspective, this feels like a single intelligent assistant but internally, it is a carefully orchestrated system.\n\n---\n\n# System Overview\n \n![](1.png)\n![](2.png)\n![](3.png)\n![](4.png)\n![](5.png)\n\n[Contact me](https://zamdatalabs.com/contact.html) to request access to the live demo.\n\n# Skills & Concepts Demonstrated\n\n- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n- Vector databases (Qdrant)\n- Embedding models (Sentence Transformers)\n- Tool-augmented LLM agents (LangChain-style)\n- SQL agents with read-only enforcement\n- Guardrails, validation, and safety constraints\n- Asynchronous Python services\n- Modular system design\n- Cloud object storage (Cloudflare R2)\n- Production-ready logging, caching, and observability\n\n\n<!-- # Document Ingestion & Parsing\n\nFor humans, the process of reading a document is intuitive and largely the same regardless of the content. When we look at a page, our eyes capture individual characters, which our brains then organize into meaningful structures such as paragraphs, tables, and charts. From there, we understand, interpret, and remember the information. Computers, in contrast, perceive information only as binary data, without any inherent understanding of structure or meaning.\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are highly effective at processing serialized text. However, to enable them to work reliably with unstructured or untagged documents, an intermediate parsing step is required. Document parsers transforms scattered characters into coherent, structured text, preserving the logical organization of the original document so that the LLM can interpret the content accurately.\n\n## Document Parsers for RAG (Commonly used)\n\n| Framework | Type | Best For |\n|-----------|------|----------|\n| **Docling** | Open-source (IBM) | Scientific documents, tables |\n| **Unstructured** | Open-source | General purpose, fast processing |\n| **LlamaParse** | Cloud service | Complex layouts, multimodal |\n| **Vectorize.io** | Cloud platform | End-to-end RAG pipelines |\n\n### Docling [Link](https://www.docling.ai/)\n\nIBM's open-source document parser with advanced table recognition.\n\n**Features:**\n- PDF, DOCX, PPTX, HTML, image parsing\n- Multiple OCR engines (RapidOCR, EasyOCR, Tesseract)\n- TableFormer for table structure recognition\n- VLM (Vision-Language Model) pipeline support\n- LangChain integration via DoclingLoader\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Implementation Snippet\" collapse=true}\n\n::: {#c8062874 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom docling.document_converter import DocumentConverter\n\nconverter = DocumentConverter()\nresult = converter.convert(\"document.pdf\")\nmarkdown = result.document.export_to_markdown()\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n### Unstructured [Link](https://unstructured.io/)\n\nFast, general-purpose document processing library.\n\n**Features:**\n- Auto-detection with `partition()` function\n- Multiple strategies: fast, hi_res, ocr_only\n- Element type filtering (Title, Table, NarrativeText, etc.)\n- Built-in chunking strategies\n- LangChain UnstructuredLoader integration\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Implementation Snippet\" collapse=true}\n\n::: {#70431a36 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom unstructured.partition.auto import partition\n\nelements = partition(filename=\"document.pdf\", strategy=\"hi_res\")\ntables = [e for e in elements if e.category == \"Table\"]\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n### LlamaParse [Link](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/cloud/llamaparse/)\n\nLlamaIndex's GenAI-native cloud parser for complex documents.\n\n**Features:**\n- Presets: fast, balanced, premium, scientific, invoice, slides\n- Multimodal extraction (charts, screenshots, OCR)\n- Structured output with JSON schemas\n- Custom parsing instructions\n- Async batch processing\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Implementation Snippet\" collapse=true}\n\n::: {#dfa345b9 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom llama_parse import LlamaParse\nfrom llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex\n\nparser = LlamaParse(result_type=\"markdown\", preset=\"scientific\")\ndocuments = parser.load_data(\"document.pdf\")\n\nindex = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)\nquery_engine = index.as_query_engine()\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n**Pricing:** Free tier 1,000 pages/day, Paid $0.003/page\n\n### Vectorize.io [Link](https://vectorize.io/)\n\nAll-in-one RAG platform with built-in vector database.\n\n**Features:**\n- Iris AI-powered extraction (100+ languages)\n- Built-in RAG Pipeline Builder (free vector DB)\n- Source connectors: File Upload, S3, Google Drive, SharePoint\n- Semantic search with re-ranking\n- Deep Research for AI-generated reports\n\n::: {.callout-tip title=\"Implementation Snippet\" collapse=true}\n\n::: {#e66423c6 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport vectorize_client as v\n\n# Create pipeline\npipeline = pipelines_api.create_pipeline(\n    org_id,\n    v.CreatePipelineRequest(\n        name=\"my_pipeline\",\n        extraction=v.ExtractionConfig(strategy=\"IRIS\"),\n        embedder=v.EmbedderConfig(provider=\"OPENAI\"),\n        vector_database=v.VectorDatabaseConfig(type=\"VECTORIZE\")\n    )\n)\n\n# Retrieve documents\nresponse = pipelines_api.retrieve_documents(\n    org_id, pipeline_id,\n    v.RetrieveDocumentsRequest(question=\"your query\", rerank=True)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n**Pricing:** Free tier 1,000 pages/day for Iris extraction\n\n## Framework Comparison\n\n| Feature | Docling | Unstructured | LlamaParse | Vectorize.io |\n|---------|---------|--------------|------------|--------------|\n| **Cost** | Free | Free | 1K pages/day free | 1K pages/day free |\n| **OCR** | Multiple engines | Tesseract | Built-in | AI-powered |\n| **Tables** | TableFormer | Built-in | AI-powered | AI-powered |\n| **Speed** | Medium | Fast | Fast | Fast |\n| **Built-in Vector DB** | No | No | No | Yes (free) |\n| **Deep Research** | No | No | No | Yes |\n\n---\n\n# Chunking Strategies\n\nChunking is the process of breaking large documents into smaller, manageable pieces of text that can be efficiently stored, indexed, and retrieved. Its primary purpose is to preserve meaningful context while ensuring that information fits within the context limits of embedding models and large language models (LLMs). Effective chunking improves retrieval precision, reduces noise, and helps LLMs generate more accurate and grounded responses.\n\nIn a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, chunking occurs during the data ingestion and indexing stage, before embeddings are created and stored in a vector database. The choice of chunking strategy directly influences what information is retrieved at query time and, ultimately, the quality of the generated answers. The table below outlines common chunking strategies used in RAG systems, along with their key advantages and trade-offs.\n\n\n\n| **Chunking Strategy**                 | **Brief Description**                                                                                                   | **Advantages**                                                                       | **Disadvantages**                                                                          |\n| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **Fixed-size chunking**               | Splits text into chunks of a predefined token or character length, often with optional overlap.                         | Simple to implement; fast; predictable chunk sizes; works well for homogeneous text. | Ignores semantic boundaries; may split sentences or ideas; can reduce retrieval relevance. |\n| **Semantic chunking**                 | Groups text based on semantic similarity, often at sentence or paragraph level.                                         | Preserves meaning; improves retrieval accuracy; better context coherence.            | Computationally expensive; depends on embeddings quality; less predictable chunk sizes.    |\n| **Recursive chunking**                | Splits text hierarchically, starting from larger sections and recursively breaking them down until size limits are met. | Balances structure and size constraints; flexible; widely used in RAG frameworks.    | More complex logic; still may split meaningful units if limits are strict.                 |\n| **Document structure-based chunking** | Uses inherent document structure (titles, headings, sections) to create chunks.                                         | Maintains logical flow; ideal for well-formatted documents; high interpretability.   | Fails on poorly structured documents; relies on accurate parsing.                          |\n| **LLM-based chunking**                | Uses an LLM to dynamically decide how to split text into meaningful chunks.                                             | Highly adaptive; preserves semantics and intent; handles complex documents well.     | Slow; costly; less deterministic; harder to debug or reproduce results.                    |\n\n---\n\n### Still under development...\n\n---\n\n# Embeddings & Vector Representations\n\n*Purpose:* Transform text chunks into numerical vector representations for semantic similarity search.\n\n## Dense Embeddings for Semantic Search\n\n*Purpose:* Generate dense vector embeddings that capture semantic meaning.\n\n## Sparse Embeddings and Keyword Signals\n\n*Purpose:* Incorporate keyword-based signals to complement dense embeddings.\n\n## Advanced Sparse Embedding Techniques\n\n*Purpose:* Apply advanced sparse representations for improved hybrid retrieval.\n\n---\n\n# Vector Stores & Indexing\n\n*Purpose:* Store and index embeddings efficiently to enable fast and scalable similarity search.\n\n## Vector Store Fundamentals\n\n*Purpose:* Introduce core concepts behind vector storage and indexing.\n\n## Index Construction and Similarity Search\n\n*Purpose:* Build and query vector indexes for nearest-neighbor retrieval.\n\n## Index Persistence and Scaling\n\n*Purpose:* Persist vector indexes and scale retrieval systems for production use.\n\n---\n\n# Retrieval Strategies\n\n*Purpose:* Retrieve the most relevant document chunks in response to user queries.\n\n## Basic Similarity-Based Retrieval\n\n*Purpose:* Retrieve top-K chunks using embedding similarity.\n\n## Fusion Retrieval (Dense + Sparse)\n\n*Purpose:* Combine dense and sparse retrieval methods to improve recall and robustness.\n\n## Adaptive Retrieval Strategies\n\n*Purpose:* Dynamically adjust retrieval behavior based on query complexity.\n\n## External Index Retrievers\n\n*Purpose:* Integrate external vector or search indexes into the retrieval pipeline.\n\n---\n\n# Query & Context Optimization\n\n*Purpose:* Improve retrieval effectiveness by refining queries and managing context windows.\n\n## Query Transformations\n\n*Purpose:* Rewrite and expand user queries to improve retrieval performance.\n\n## Context Enrichment with Sliding Windows\n\n*Purpose:* Enrich retrieved context by aggregating adjacent chunks intelligently.\n\n---\n\n# Reranking for Retrieval Quality\n\n*Purpose:* Improve retrieval precision by reordering retrieved results using stronger models.\n\n## Reranking Fundamentals\n\n*Purpose:* Introduce reranking concepts and their role in retrieval quality.\n\n## Cross-Encoder Reranking Pipelines\n\n*Purpose:* Apply cross-encoder models to rerank retrieved chunks for maximum relevance.\n\n---\n\n# End-to-End RAG Pipelines\n\n*Purpose:* Integrate ingestion, retrieval, and generation into a complete RAG system.\n\n## Building a Complete RAG Pipeline\n\n*Purpose:* Assemble all components into a functional end-to-end RAG workflow.\n\n## Modular vs Monolithic RAG Design\n\n*Purpose:* Compare design approaches for building maintainable and scalable RAG systems.\n\n---\n\n# Advanced Retrieval Techniques\n\n*Purpose:* Explore advanced methods to improve retrieval under difficult query conditions.\n\n## Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE)\n\n*Purpose:* Use generated hypothetical documents to enhance retrieval for underspecified queries.\n\n---\n\n# RAG Evaluation & Quality Assessment\n\n*Purpose:* Measure retrieval and generation quality using automated and LLM-based evaluation.\n\n## RAG Evaluation with RAGAS\n\n*Purpose:* Evaluate RAG pipelines using faithfulness, relevance, and context metrics.\n\n## LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation\n\n*Purpose:* Assess answer quality using LLM-based judging frameworks.\n\n## Deep Dive into RAGAS Metrics\n\n*Purpose:* Analyze individual RAGAS metrics to diagnose system weaknesses.\n\n---\n\n# Deployed Prototype Solution\n\n--- -->\n\n# References\n\n - [Docling](https://www.docling.ai/)\n\n - [Chonkie](https://docs.chonkie.ai/oss/quick-start)\n\n - [Sentence Transformers](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers)\n\n - [Qwen3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388)\n\n - [Groq](https://groq.com/)\n\n - [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/)\n\n - [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/)\n\n - [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/agents)\n\n - [Upstash](https://upstash.com/)\n\n",
