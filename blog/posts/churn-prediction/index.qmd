## Project Overview

In this project, we explore customer churn using a telecom dataset and build a machine learning model to predict if a customer is likely to leave.

## Dataset Preview

```{python}
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "CustomerID": [1001, 1002, 1003],
    "MonthlyCharges": [29.85, 56.95, 53.85],
    "Churn": ["No", "Yes", "No"]
})

df
```
